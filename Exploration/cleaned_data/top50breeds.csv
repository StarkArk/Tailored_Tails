Australian Cattle Dog,"Standing between 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns blue-gray or red. Both coat varieties feature distinctive mottling or specking patterns. ACDs have immense work drive and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners.ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously smart, ever alert, and wary of strangers. If an ACD isn’t challenged, he easily becomes bored and gets into mischief. It is recommended that ACD owners participate with their dog in some work, sport, or regular exercise to keep him mentally and physically fit. The compact but muscular Australian Cattle Dog, also called Blue Heeler or Queensland Heeler, is related to Australia’s famous wild dog, the Dingo. These resilient herders are intelligent enough to routinely outsmart their owners.","Alert, Curious, Pleasant",0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.8,Regularly,1,Needs Lots of Activity,0.2,May be Stubborn,0.4,Reserved with Strangers,46.989999999999995,14,19.27767573,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Australian-Cattle-Dog-laying-down-in-the-grass.jpg
Australian Shepherd,"The Australian Shepherd, the cowboy’s herding dog of choice, is a medium-sized worker with a keen, penetrating gaze in the eye. Aussie coats offer different looks, including merle (a mottled pattern with contrasting shades of blue or red). In all ways, they’re the picture of rugged and agile movers of stock. Aussies exhibit an irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs, kids. This strong work drive can make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner. Aussies are remarkably intelligent, quite capable of hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice owner. In short, this isn’t the pet for everyone. But if you’re looking for a brainy, tireless, and trainable partner for work or sport, your search might end here. The Australian Shepherd, a lean, tough ranch dog, is one of those “only in America” stories: a European breed perfected in California by way of Australia.

Bassets are famous for a large, domed head that features extremely long, velvety ears, mournful eyes, and a wrinkled brow, which give the breed the look of a sad clown. Built more for endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner.

Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they are steadfastly loyal.

They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed. The one-of-a-kind French Bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the world’s most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers. The Frenchie is playful, alert, adaptable, and completely irresistible.","Adaptable, Playful, Smart",0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.8,Regularly,0.4,Calm,0.6,Agreeable,0.6,Alert/Responsive,30.480000000000004,11,12.70058636,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/French-Bulldog-standing-outdoors.jpg
German Shepherd Dog,"German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there’s a “certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.” Generally considered dogkind’s finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover’s delight.","Confident, Courageous, Smart",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,0.6,Regular Exercise,1,Eager to Please,0.6,Alert/Responsive,60.96000000000001,8.5,31.7514659,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://cdn.akc.org/content/hero/gsd_miami_hero.jpg
German Shorthaired Pointer,"Male German Shorthaired Pointers stand between 23 and 25 inches at the shoulder and weigh anywhere from 55 to 70 pounds; females run smaller. The coat is solid liver (a reddish brown), or liver and white in distinctive patterns. The dark eyes shine with enthusiasm and friendliness. Built to work long days in the field or at the lake, GSPs are known for power, speed, agility, and endurance. “Noble” and “aristocratic” are words often used to describe the overall look.GSPs make happy, trainable pets who bond firmly to their family. They are always up for physical activities like running, swimming, organized dog sports—in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending outdoors time with a human buddy. The versatile, medium-sized German Shorthaired Pointer is an enthusiastic gundog of all trades who thrives on vigorous exercise, positive training, and a lot of love. GSP people call their aristocratic companions the “perfect pointer.”","Friendly, Smart, Willing to Please",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,1,Needs Lots of Activity,1,Eager to Please,0.8,Friendly,58.42,11,26.081561275000002,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://cdn.akc.org/content/article-body-image/gsp_body_image_2.jpg
Golden Retriever,"The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a “merry action.”The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth’s great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes. The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America’s most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.","Friendly, Intelligent, Devoted",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,1,Needs Lots of Activity,1,Eager to Please,0.8,Friendly,57.785,11,29.48350405,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Golden-Retriever-in-the-Event1.jpg
Great Dane,"As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs—and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as “harlequin.”Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed’s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily. The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty “Apollo of Dogs,” is a total joy to live with—but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength is a commitment not to be entered into lightly. This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane.","Friendly, Patient, Dependable",0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.6,Alert/Responsive,76.2,8.5,64.63691273,0.8,Large 55-75lb,https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07141952/Great-Dane-standing-in-profile-outdoors1.jpg
Havanese,"Distinctive features of the Havanese include a curled-over tail and a gorgeous silky coat, which comes in a variety of colors. Some owners enjoy cording the coat, in the manner of a Puli, and others clip it short to reduce grooming time. Happily, Havenese are just as cute no matter what hairdo you give them.Their small but sturdy bodies, adaptable nature, and social skills make Havanese an ideal city dog, but they are content to be anywhere that they can command the attention of admirers young and old alike. Havanese, smart and trainable extroverts with the comic instincts of a born clown, are natural trick dogs. Havanese are also excellent watchdogs and take the job seriously, but will usually keep the barking to a minimum. Havanese, the only dog breed native to Cuba, are cheerful little dogs with a spring in their step and a gleam in their big, brown eyes. These vivacious and sociable companions are becoming especially popular with American city dwellers.","Intelligent, Outgoing, Funny",0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.4,Occasional,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.8,Easy Training,1,Outgoing,25.4,15,4.535923700000001,0.2,Toy >9lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Havanese-standing-outdoors.jpg
Labrador Retriever,"The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering “otter tail” seems to be forever signaling the breed’s innate eagerness.Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don’t mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit. The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America’s most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog.","Friendly, Active, Outgoing",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,1,Needs Lots of Activity,1,Eager to Please,1,Outgoing,58.42,11,30.61748498,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AdobeStock_491912561-800x600.jpeg
Maltese,"Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered by a long, straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body moving with a smooth and effortless gait. The overall picture depicts free-flowing elegance and balance. The irresistible Maltese face—with its big, dark eyes and black gumdrop nose—can conquer the most jaded sensibility.Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based training. The tiny Maltese, “Ye Ancient Dogge of Malta,” has been sitting in the lap of luxury since the Bible was a work in progress.

Mastiff,"For the uninitiated, a face-to-face encounter with these black-masked giants can be startling. A male stands at least 30 inches at the shoulder and can outweigh many a full-grown man. The rectangular body is deep and thickly muscled, covered by a short double coat of fawn, apricot, or brindle stripes. The head is broad and massive, and a wrinkled forehead accentuates an alert, kindly expression. Mastiffs are patient, lovable companions and guardians who take best to gentle training. Eternally loyal Mastiffs are protective of family, and a natural wariness of strangers makes early training and socialization essential. Mastiffs are magnificent pets, but acquiring a powerful giant-breed dog is commitment not to be taken lightly. The colossal Mastiff belongs to a canine clan as ancient as civilization itself. A massive, heavy-boned dog of courage and prodigious strength, the Mastiff is docile and dignified but also a formidable protector of those they hold dear.","Courageous, Dignified, Good-Natured",0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.4,Occasional,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.6,Alert/Responsive,73.025,8,79.37866475,1,Giant <75lb,https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/12230849/Mastiff-On-White-03.jpg
Miniature American Shepherd,"The Miniature American Shepherd shares many physical traits with its forebear the Australian Shepherd—only on a smaller scale. Females stand between 13 and 17 inches at the shoulder; males range from 14 to 18 inches. Despite their size, Minis are every inch a true herding dog: energetic, versatile, rugged, and extremely bright. The eye-catching coat comes in black, blue merle, red, and red merle. (The merle will exhibit in any amount marbling, flecks, or blotches.) Minis move with the smooth and agile step of a dog built for hard work on punishing terrain. The Miniature American Shepherd resembles a small Australian Shepherd. True herders in spite of their compact size, Minis are bright, self-motivated workers and endearingly loyal and lively companion dogs who have an affinity for horses.","Good-Natured, Intelligent, Devoted",0.8,Daily Brushing,1,Frequent,0.8,Energetic,1,Eager to Please,0.8,Friendly,39.370000000000005,12.5,13.607771099999999,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Miniature-American-Shepherd-On-White-01.jpg
Miniature Schnauzer,"Stocky, robust little dogs standing 12 to 14 inches, Miniature Schnauzers were bred down from their larger cousins, Standard Schnauzers. The bushy beard and eyebrows give Minis a charming, human-like expression. The hard, wiry coat comes in three color patterns: salt and pepper, black and silver, and solid black. Created to be all-around farm dogs and ratters, they are tough, muscular, and fearless without being aggressive.The Miniature Schnauzer is a bright, friendly, trainable companion, small enough to adapt to apartment life but tireless enough to patrol acres of farmland. They get along well with other animals and kids. Minis are sturdy little guys and enjoy vigorous play. Home and family oriented, they make great watchdogs. The Miniature Schnauzer, the smallest of the three Schnauzer breeds, is a generally healthy, long-lived, and low-shedding companion. Add an outgoing personality, a portable size, and sporty good looks, and you’ve got an ideal family dog.","Friendly, Smart, Obedient",1,Specialty/Professional,0.2,Infrequent,0.6,Regular Exercise,1,Eager to Please,0.6,Alert/Responsive,33.02,13.5,7.030681735,0.2,Toy >9lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Miniature-Schnauzer-On-White-01.jpg
Newfoundland,"A male Newfoundland can weigh up to 150 pounds and stand 28 inches at the shoulder; females typically go 100 to 120 pounds. The Newf head is majestic, the expression soft and soulful. The outer coat is flat and coarse. Colors are gray, brown, black, and a black-and-white coat named for artist Sir Edwin Landseer, who popularized the look in his paintings.The Newfie breed standard says that a sweet temperament is the “most important single characteristic of the breed.” The Newf’s sterling character is expressed in their affinity for kids. Trusting and trainable, Newfs respond well to gentle guidance. These noble giants are among the world’s biggest dogs, and acquiring a pet that could outweigh you comes with obvious challenges. The massive Newfoundland is a strikingly large, powerful working dog of heavy bone and dignified bearing. The sweet-tempered Newfie is a famously good companion and has earned a reputation as a patient and watchful “nanny dog” for kids.","Sweet, Patient, Devoted",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.8,Easy Training,0.8,Friendly,68.58000000000001,9.5,56.699046249999995,0.8,Large 55-75lb,https://cdn.akc.org/content/hero/newfoundland_header_image.jpg
Pembroke Welsh Corgi,"At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day’s work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a “big dog” bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke’s need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet. Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy. They are one of the world's most popular herding breeds.","Affectionate, Smart, Alert",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,1,Outgoing,27.939999999999998,12.5,13.154178730000002,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Pembroke-Welsh-Corgi-standing-outdoors-in-the-fall.jpg
Pomeranian,"The Pomeranian combines a tiny body (no more than seven pounds) and a commanding big-dog demeanor. The abundant double coat, with its frill extending over the chest and shoulders, comes in almost two dozen colors, and various patterns and markings, but is most commonly seen in orange or red.Alert and intelligent, Pomeranians are easily trained and make fine watchdogs and perky pets for families with children old enough to know the difference between a toy dog and a toy. Poms are active but can be exercised with indoor play and short walks, so they are content in both the city and suburbs. They will master tricks and games with ease, though their favorite activity is providing laughs and companionship to their special human. The tiny Pomeranian, long a favorite of royals and commoners alike, has been called the ideal companion. The glorious coat, smiling, foxy face, and vivacious personality have helped make the Pom one of the world's most popular toy breeds.","Inquisitive, Bold, Lively",0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.6,Alert/Responsive,16.51,14,2.26796185,0.2,Toy >9lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Pomeranian-On-White-01.jpg
Poodle (Standard),"Poodles come in three size varieties: Standards should be more than 15 inches tall at the shoulder; Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys stand no more than 10 inches. All three varieties have the same build and proportions. At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental Clip. Most pet owners prefer the simpler Sporting Clip, in which the coat is shorn to follow the outline of the squarely built, smoothly muscled body.Forget those old stereotypes of Poodles as sissy dogs. Poodles are eager, athletic, and wickedly smart “real dogs” of remarkable versatility. The Standard, with his greater size and strength, is the best all-around athlete of the family, but all Poodles can be trained with great success. Whether Standard, Miniature, or Toy, and either black, white, or apricot, the Poodle stands proudly among dogdom’s true aristocrats.

Portuguese Water Dog,"The Portuguese Water Dog is super-smart and very biddable—meaning he’s easy to train and eager to please. The breed can be groomed in two styles: The retriever clip (the entire coat is clipped to one inch in length, with the tail tip at full length) or the more check-me-out lion clip, where the coat on the hindquarters and muzzle is clipped down to the skin. The bright and biddable Portuguese Water Dog was bred to be an all-around fisherman’s helper. The robust, medium-sized body is covered by a coat of tight, low-shedding curls. They are eager and athletic companions built for water work.","Affectionate, Adventurous, Athletic",0.8,Daily Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.8,Easy Training,0.6,Alert/Responsive,50.8,12,21.54563758,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portuguese-Water-Dog-standing-in-profile-outdoors.jpg
Pug,"The Pug’s motto is the Latin phrase “multum in parvo” (a lot in a little)—an apt description of this small but muscular breed. They come in three colors: silver or apricot-fawn with a black face mask, or all black. The large round head, the big, sparkling eyes, and the wrinkled brow give Pugs a range of human-like expressions—surprise, happiness, curiosity—that have delighted owners for centuries.Pug owners say their breed is the ideal house dog. Pugs are happy in the city or country, with kids or old folks, as an only pet or in a pack. They enjoy their food, and care must be taken to keep them trim. They do best in moderate climates—not too hot, not too cold—but, with proper care, Pugs can be their adorable selves anywhere. Once the mischievous companion of Chinese emperors, and later the mascot of Holland’s royal House of Orange, the small but solid Pug is today adored by his millions of fans around the world.

Rhodesian Ridgeback,"Beneath the Ridgeback’s trademark ridge is a whole lot of hound: Ridgebacks are fast and powerful athletes who can weigh between 70 and 85 pounds, and oftentimes more. They come in only one color – wheaten – which spans every shade seen in a wheat field, from pale flaxen to the burnished red of a maturing crop. Ridgebacks also have two nose colors: black and the less commonly seen brown.The formidable Ridgeback can be strong willed, independent, and sometimes domineering. Ridgebacks must be guided with a firm but fair hand from puppyhood. They are faithful friends, protective of their loved ones and meltingly affectionate with those whom they trust. Still, a Ridgeback can be too much hound for the novice dog owner. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an all-purpose “Renaissance hound” whose hallmark is the ridge, or stripe of backward-growing hair, on his back. Though the breed was made famous in its native Africa for its skill at tracking and baying – but never, ever killing – lions, today Ridgebacks are cherished family dogs whose owners must be prepared to deal with their independence and strong prey drive.","Affectionate, Dignified, Even-Tempered",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.4,Independent,0.6,Alert/Responsive,64.77,10,35.15340868,0.6,Medium 35-55lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rhodesian-Ridgeback-laying-down-in-the-yard-400x267.jpg
Rottweiler,"A male Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and lighter. The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength. A thickly muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie’s effortless trotting gait.A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he’s not a toy breed, so he is liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.) Early training and socialization will harness a Rottie’s territorial instincts in a positive way. The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie observes the outside world with a self-assured aloofness.","Loyal, Loving, Confident Guardian",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.4,Reserved with Strangers,62.230000000000004,9.5,48.76117978,0.6,Medium 35-55lb,https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/27165806/Rottweiler-laying-down-next-to-her-puppy-in-the-grass.jpeg
Shetland Sheepdog,"The Shetland Sheepdog is a small, active, and agile herding dog standing between 13 and 16 inches at the shoulder. The long coat is harsh and straight, with a dense undercoat, and comes in black, blue merle, and sable, with white markings. The coat, along with a long, wedge-shaped head; small, three-quarter erect ears; and deep-chested, level-backed torso, give Shelties the look of a rough-coated Collie in miniature.Bright and eager Shelties are easy trainers and world-class competitors in obedience, agility, and herding trials. They are sensitive and affectionate family dogs, highly in tune with the mood of the household. They like to bark and tend to be reserved toward strangers—two qualifications of an excellent watchdog. The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is an extremely intelligent, quick, and obedient herder from Scotland’s remote and rugged Shetland Islands. Shelties bear a strong family resemblance to their bigger cousin, the Collie.","Playful, Energetic, Bright",0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,1,Eager to Please,0.4,Reserved with Strangers,36.83,13,9.0718474,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Shetland-Sheepdog-face.jpg
Shiba Inu,"Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. They’re sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match. An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country.","Alert, Active, Attentive",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.4,Independent,0.4,Reserved with Strangers,38.099999999999994,14.5,9.0718474,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Shiba-Inu-standing-in-profile-outdoors.jpg
Shih Tzu,"Shih Tzu (pronounced in the West “sheed-zoo” or “sheet-su”; the Chinese say “sher-zer”), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it—few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer. The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children. As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard. Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, but a Shih Tzu’s idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV. That face! Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It’s no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been so delighted with this little “Lion Dog” for a thousand years.

Siberian Husky,"The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor. The Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. This northern breed is friendly, fastidious, and dignified.","Loyal, Mischievous, Outgoing",0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.4,Independent,0.8,Friendly,55.245,13,21.54563758,0.4,Small 9-35lb,https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Siberian-Husky-standing-outdoors-in-the-winter.jpg
Vizsla,"The Vizsla is easily recognized by his sleek golden-rust coat. They can stand between 21 to 24 inches at the shoulder and are the picture of a lean, light-footed hunter’s companion. The long, silky ears frame a facial expression that is sensitive and loving around the house and intense when at work.
